# Aeon - A runtime for Luna ⏳✨

Aeon is an extremely tiny, but easy to use WebAssembly runtime, built for demonstration and educational purposes.
It is so tiny that supports only additions, subtractions and i32 integers.

It is part of the <a href="https://github.com/thomscoder/luna" target="_blank">Luna</a> project, so they integrate very very well.
Its purpose is to give an high-level overview of how to build a custom WebAssembly runtime.

It is by no means a replacement for runtimes like <a href="https://wasmer.io/">Wasmer</a> or <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime">Wasmtime</a>, it is just a tool that aims to serve as a `landmark` for anyone that wants to start learning Wasm.

Hence, I tried to document it as much as I could!

# How to use❓
Aeon was built with Luna in mind and they travel together so whatever Luna can compile, Aeon can run.
 - Pass the Wasm binary compiled by <a href="https://luna-demo.vercel.app/" target="_blank">Luna</a>, the function name and parameters to the main function.
 - Done (you should see the result)

 (Check the `./example/example.js`)

 ```js
import createAeonRuntime from "./runtime/start"
 // This binary
 // - takes 3 parameters of type `i32` (3, 127, 127, 127)
 // - outputs one `i32` result (1, 127)
 // - exports a function called "addNumbers" (12, 34, 97, 100, 100, 78, 117, 109, 98, 101, 114, 115, 34)
 // - that adds them all (0, 32, 0, 32, 1, 32, 2, 106, 11)
const wasmBinary = new Uint8Array([0, 97, 115, 109, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 1, 96, 3, 127, 127, 127, 1, 127, 3, 2, 1, 0, 7, 16, 1, 12, 34, 97, 100, 100, 78, 117, 109, 98, 101, 114, 115, 34, 0, 0, 10, 9, 1, 7, 0, 32, 0, 32, 1, 32, 2, 106, 11]);

const n1 = 8;
const n2 = 20;
const n3 = 23;

const runtime = createAeonRuntime(wasmBinary);
const result = runtime("addNumbers", n1, n2, n3);
console.log(`${n1} + ${n2} + ${n3} =`, result) // prints 51
 ```

# Roadmap
- `Optimizations` it is not very optimized yet - (as I'm learning too)
- `Support more wasm feature` currently it supports only additions and i32 integers, but it makes it easy to add more features

# Contribute
Both Aeon and Luna are infants.
There are tons and tons of feature they could implement. I try to keep them as much basic as possible as they should serve as a learning playground rather than making competition to other tools.

If you have any suggestion, feedback or want to add features, feel free to open issues, pull requests or fork the project.
Turn it into a npm package, embed it in your next project, build beautiful tutorials...
Aeon will be able (in the near future) to be open to all the possibilities to teach Web Assembly.
